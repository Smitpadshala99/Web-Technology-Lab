    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
        While I don't have experience in a company, I've gained valuable experience through project work. Here are some of my key projects:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Hostel Management System - Hackathon project</strong><br>
            I participated in a hackathon organized by VGEC. In this project, I contributed to the development of a Hostel Management System, working as part of a team to create an efficient and user-friendly system.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Algorithm Simulator - OS project</strong><br>
            As part of an Operating System course, I worked on developing different operating system algorithm simulations. This project helped me deepen my understanding of OS concepts and algorithms.
